### Probability

applied to population-level variables to describe the magnitude of chance associated with a particular observation or events.

Probabilities for events or collections of events necessarily vary between zero and one. Outcomes or combinations of outcomes that are impossible have Pr=0, those that are certain have Pr=1.
